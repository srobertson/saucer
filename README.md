# Saucer - The Elm Architecture for Rust

![Saucer Tea Party](docs/assets/tea-party-hero.png)

**Status: Coming Soon**

Saucer is a Rust framework implementing The Elm Architecture (TEA) - a pattern for building robust, maintainable applications with:

- **Pure Business Logic**: Model and update functions with no side effects
- **Explicit Side Effects**: Commands and subscriptions for controlled external interactions
- **Type Safety**: Leverage Rust's type system for compile-time guarantees
- **Composability**: Build complex applications from simple, testable components

The Elm Architecture provides a simple pattern: `Model + Event → (Model, Commands)`, making your application logic predictable, testable, and easy to reason about.

Stay tuned for the release!
